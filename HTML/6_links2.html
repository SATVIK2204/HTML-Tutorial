        Chandler works in 'Statistical analysis and Data reconfiguration,' but loathes it, although it pays well.<br/><br/>

    Chandler was Ross Geller's roommate in college. Chandler met his future wife Monica Geller while celebrating Thanksgiving with the Geller family during his first year at college. On a tip from Monica, Chandler later moved to Apartment #19 in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, across the hall from Monica and her roommate Phoebe Buffay. Actor Joey Tribbiani moves in with Chandler, who becomes his best friend.<br/><br/>

    <h2 id="relationship">Relationships</h2>  
    <p>
        Chandler is afraid of commitment and had the fewest relationships out of all the Friends.[citation needed] Despite all this, he and Monica are the first to have a committed marriage that doesn't end in divorce.<br/><br/>

At Ross' wedding in London, Monica and Chandler sleep together and decide to begin dating. They try to keep their relationship secret, as they are unsure about how the others would react. Eventually, however, they all find out and give their blessing. Things briefly become strained when Monica reveals that she had initially been looking for Joey for a one-night-stand, but they reconcile. Their wedding takes place during the finale of season 7. In the final episode of the series, Monica and Chandler adopt twins, due to their inability to conceive.<br/><br/>

    <h2 id="career">Career</h2>
    <p>
        Chandler works in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration, which he takes up as temporary work.[citation needed] Despite disliking his job, Chandler stays because they keep giving him promotions and raises, eventually becoming boss to his old workmates. His friends do not understand what he does (except Ross because he was the one who prepared the questions); during the contest for Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel guesses "Transponster" for his job title. This results in Chandler and Joey winning the apartment.<br/><br/>

In the episode "The One Where Emma Cries", Chandler falls asleep during a meeting and on waking, realizes that he had agreed to head the new division in Tulsa. Chandler quits his job on Christmas, so that he can fly home to New York to be with Monica. Monica helps Chandler secure a job in advertising through an old colleague of hers. Much to Chandler's dismay, he begins as an unpaid intern. However, his more mature approach eventually pays off, and he secures a full-time job in the business as a junior copywriter, which he enjoys much more than his previous career.<br/><br/>
